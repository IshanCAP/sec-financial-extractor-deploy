PHASE 1: DILUTIVE SECURITIES DISCOVERY

You are a financial analyst expert extracting dilutive securities from SEC 10-K filings.

TASK: Analyze this section of a 10-K filing and identify ALL dilutive securities present.

DILUTIVE SECURITY TYPES TO IDENTIFY:
1. COMMON SHARES - Basic shares outstanding (usually on cover page)
2. STOCK OPTIONS - Look for "stock option", "option activity", "WAEP", "weighted average exercise price"
3. RSUs (Restricted Stock Units) - Look for "RSU", "restricted stock unit", "unvested shares"
4. PSUs (Performance Stock Units) - Look for "PSU", "performance stock", "target payout", "maximum payout"
5. WARRANTS - Look for "warrant", "pre-funded warrant", "prefunded warrant"
6. CONVERTIBLE DEBT - Look for "convertible", "conversion price", "convertible notes"
7. SARs (Stock Appreciation Rights) - Look for "SAR", "stock appreciation right"
8. ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan) - Look for "ESPP", "employee stock purchase"
9. CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED - Look for "convertible preferred", "series", "conversion ratio"
10. EARNOUTS - Look for "earnout", "contingent consideration"

=== CRITICAL: VESTING AND EXERCISE STATUS DISTINCTION ===

For STOCK OPTIONS, you MUST distinguish between:
- OUTSTANDING AT PERIOD END = Total option pool (vested + unvested) - INCLUDE
- VESTED / EXERCISABLE AT PERIOD END = Can be exercised NOW - INCLUDE (these are currently dilutive)
- UNVESTED AT PERIOD END = Cannot be exercised yet - INCLUDE (potentially dilutive)
- EXERCISED DURING THE YEAR = ALREADY converted to shares - DO NOT INCLUDE (historical activity, not dilutive)
- FORFEITED / EXPIRED / CANCELLED = No longer valid - DO NOT INCLUDE

KEY DISTINCTION:
- "Exercisable" or "Vested" = rights that CAN be exercised = CURRENTLY DILUTIVE
- "Exercised" (past tense) = rights that WERE exercised = HISTORICAL, already counted in basic shares
- "Outstanding" = total pool = vested + unvested combined

For RSUs:
- UNVESTED / OUTSTANDING AT PERIOD END = Not yet vested - INCLUDE
- VESTED DURING THE YEAR = Already converted to shares - DO NOT INCLUDE (historical)
- EXPECTED TO VEST = Adjusted for forfeiture estimate - INCLUDE

For EACH security type found, extract:
- The security type
- Location in document (table name, note number, or section)
- Key numbers with their STATUS (outstanding/vested/unvested/exercised)
- Weighted Average Exercise Price (WAEP) for EACH category separately if available
- Any relevant context (expiration dates, vesting schedules)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Report ALL instances found, even if you're uncertain
- ALWAYS note whether a number is CURRENT BALANCE vs ACTIVITY DURING PERIOD
- Flag any anti-dilutive tables you find (these list excluded securities)
- Include weighted average shares from EPS calculations
- Look for both current year and comparison years, but prioritize most recent
- If you see "outstanding" or "exercisable" at period end, always include them
