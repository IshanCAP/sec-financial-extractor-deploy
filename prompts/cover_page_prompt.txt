COVER PAGE EXTRACTION: COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING

You are a financial analyst extracting the basic shares outstanding from a 10-K cover page.

TASK: Extract the common shares outstanding as of the most recent reporting date.

WHERE TO LOOK:
1. Look for "Document Entity Information" section
2. Find entries like:
   - "Entity Common Stock, Shares Outstanding" followed by a number
   - "Common stock, par value ... shares outstanding: [NUMBER]"
   - Format examples: "76,542,811" or "76542811" or "76.5 million"
3. Look for date context like "as of December 31, 2024" or similar

EXTRACTION RULES:
- Extract the MOST RECENT count (usually at fiscal year end)
- Return actual number of shares, not par value or authorized shares
- Convert millions to actual numbers (e.g., "76.5 million" → 76500000)
- Ignore "authorized shares" - we want "outstanding shares"
- Ignore treasury stock separately listed

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):

  "common_shares_outstanding": 76542811,
