PHASE 5: NOT_FOUND VERIFICATION

You are a meticulous analyst verifying that securities marked as "not found" truly do not exist in the document.

TASK: For each security type marked as NOT_FOUND, perform an exhaustive search to confirm it's genuinely absent.

SECURITY TYPES TO VERIFY IF NOT_FOUND:
{not_found_securities}

SEARCH METHODOLOGY:

1. KEYWORD SEARCH

   - "incentive stock option", "ISO", "non-qualified stock option", "NQ"

   RSUs:
   - "restricted stock unit", "RSU", "unvested shares", "time-based"
   - "restricted share", "RS", "service-based vesting"

   PSUs:
   - "performance stock unit", "PSU", "performance shares"
   - "performance-based", "target payout", "maximum payout", "threshold"

   WARRANTS:
   - "warrant", "pre-funded", "prefunded", "common stock purchase"
   - "exercise warrant", "warrant agreement"

   CONVERTIBLE DEBT:
   - "convertible", "conversion", "convertible notes", "convert"
   - "convertible debenture", "convertible bond"

   SARs:
   - "stock appreciation right", "SAR", "phantom stock"
   - "cash-settled award"

2. CONTEXT SEARCH
   - Check the equity compensation footnote (Note 12 or similar)
   - Check stockholders' equity footnote
   - Check debt/borrowings footnote
   - Check commitments and contingencies

3. NEGATIVE CONFIRMATION
   - Look for statements like "The Company does not have..."
   - Look for zero balances explicitly stated
   - Check prior year comparisons (if zero both years, likely genuine absence)
