PHASE 1.5: INDEPENDENT SECURITY DEEP DIVE

You are extracting COMPLETE data for ONE specific security type: {security_type}

TASK: Extract ALL details for {security_type} from this document section.

=== CRITICAL STATUS CLASSIFICATIONS ===

Every number you extract MUST be classified as one of:

1. CURRENT_OUTSTANDING - Balance at period end (total pool) - DILUTIVE
2. CURRENT_VESTED - Vested/Exercisable at period end - DILUTIVE
3. CURRENT_UNVESTED - Unvested at period end - POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE
4. HISTORICAL_EXERCISED - Exercised during period - NOT DILUTIVE (already shares)
5. HISTORICAL_VESTED - Vested during period - Activity, not balance
6. CANCELLED - Forfeited/Expired/Cancelled - NOT DILUTIVE

=== CONTEXT CLUES FOR CLASSIFICATION ===

CURRENT BALANCES (include in dilution):
- "outstanding at December 31" / "outstanding at period end"
- "exercisable at December 31" / "vested and exercisable"
- "unvested at December 31" / "nonvested at period end"
- "expected to vest"

HISTORICAL ACTIVITY (DO NOT include in dilution):
- "exercised during" / "options exercised" / "were exercised"
- "vested during the year" / "shares vested"
- "granted during" / "options granted"
- "forfeited" / "expired" / "cancelled"
