QUICK SCAN: IDENTIFY NOTES WITH DILUTIVE SECURITIES

You are a financial analyst doing a PERMISSIVE quick scan of 10-K note titles to identify which notes MIGHT POSSIBLY contain dilutive securities.

TASK: Review the list of note titles below and identify which notes MIGHT POSSIBLY contain dilutive instruments.

YOUR GOAL: Cast a WIDE NET. It is FAR BETTER to flag 10 notes that turn out empty than to miss 1 note with dilutive securities.

DILUTIVE INSTRUMENTS typically appear in notes about:
- Stock-based compensation / Share-based payments / Share-based compensation
- Equity compensation plans / Equity incentive plans
- Stock options / Employee stock options
- Restricted stock units (RSUs) / Restricted stock awards (RSAs)
- Performance stock units (PSUs) / Performance shares
- Warrants / Common stock warrants / Prefunded warrants
- Convertible debt / Convertible notes / Convertible senior notes
- Convertible preferred stock / Preferred stock
- Stockholders' equity / Shareholders' equity / Equity
- Share capital / Capital stock / Common stock
- Equity awards / Stock awards
- Employee benefit plans / Incentive plans / Long-term incentive plans
- Long-term debt (may contain convertible notes)
- Financing arrangements (may contain warrants)
- Debt (may have conversion features)
- Capital structure (may discuss equity instruments)
- Subsequent events (may describe equity issuances)

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "notes_with_dilutive_securities": [
    "note_9",
    "note_12",
    "note_14"
  ],
  "reasoning": {
    "note_9": "Share Capital - likely contains equity instruments",
    "note_12": "Stock-Based Compensation - likely contains options/RSUs",
    "note_14": "Convertible Debt - may contain convertible instruments"
  }
}

IMPORTANT RULES (READ CAREFULLY):
1. **ERR HEAVILY ON THE SIDE OF INCLUSION** - When in doubt, FLAG IT
2. **FALSE POSITIVES ARE ACCEPTABLE** - We'd rather check 20 notes than miss 1 dilutive security
3. **FALSE NEGATIVES ARE UNACCEPTABLE** - Missing a note with dilutive securities defeats the entire purpose
4. If a note title contains ANY of these words, FLAG IT immediately:
   - Stock, Share, Equity, Warrant, Option, RSU, PSU, Convertible, Compensation, Incentive, Award, Capital, Preferred
5. If a note title is ambiguous or vague (e.g., "Note 12 - Additional Information"), FLAG IT (it might contain surprises)
6. Even notes about "Debt", "Financing", or "Subsequent Events" should be flagged (they often contain warrants or convertible features)
7. Return note_X format (e.g., "note_9", "note_12")
8. **WHEN UNCERTAIN, ALWAYS FLAG THE NOTE**

EXAMPLES OF NOTES YOU SHOULD FLAG:
- "Stock-Based Compensation" ✓ (obvious)
- "Stockholders' Equity" ✓ (obvious)
- "Long-Term Debt" ✓ (may have convertible notes)
- "Financing Arrangements" ✓ (may have warrants)
- "Subsequent Events" ✓ (may describe equity issuances)
- "Capital Structure" ✓ (discusses equity instruments)
- "Note 12 - Additional Disclosures" ✓ (vague - might contain anything)

EXAMPLES OF NOTES YOU SHOULD NOT FLAG:
- "Revenue Recognition" ✗ (clearly about revenue)
- "Income Taxes" ✗ (clearly about taxes)
- "Property and Equipment" ✗ (clearly about fixed assets)
- "Leases" ✗ (clearly about lease accounting)

Return ONLY the JSON, no other text.
