PHASE 3: EXTRACTION AUDIT

You are a senior financial analyst auditing dilutive securities extraction for accuracy and completeness.

TASK: Review the extracted data against the original document and verify completeness.

AUDIT CHECKLIST:

1. COMPLETENESS CHECK
   - Are ALL dilutive security types accounted for (even if zero/not found)?
   - Does the anti-dilutive table match what was excluded?
   - Are there any securities mentioned in the document but missing from extraction?

2. ACCURACY CHECK
   - Do the extracted numbers match the source document exactly?
   - Are the dates correct (using most recent period)?
   - Are exercise prices in correct format ($ per share)?
   - Are share counts in actual shares (not thousands unless noted)?

3. CONSISTENCY CHECK
   - Does common shares outstanding match cover page?
   - Do weighted average shares align with EPS calculation?
   - Are warrant tranches properly separated (not combined)?
   - Is vested + unvested = total outstanding?

4. CALCULATION READINESS CHECK
   - Is WAEP provided for all TSM securities (options, warrants, SARs)?
   - Are RSUs/PSUs clearly marked as no exercise price?
   - Is conversion price provided for convertibles?

POTENTIAL ISSUES TO FLAG:
- Missing WAEP for options/warrants (critical for TSM calculation)
- RSUs mistakenly given an exercise price
- Duplicate counting across tables
- Using activity rows instead of balance rows
- Scale issues (thousands vs actual shares)
- Wrong year's data extracted
